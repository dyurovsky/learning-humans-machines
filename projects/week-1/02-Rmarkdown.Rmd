library(tidyverse)
```

## Models

Here's an example regression model:

```{r}
mpg_model <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
summary(mpg_model)
```

Neat! It's kind of ugly when you knit, but later I'll show you how to make this look pretty.

You can also include graphics:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mtcars, 
       mapping = aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = as.factor(cyl))) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

If you want to run R code within a paragraph of text instead of in a chunk, you can do that too. Like, 2 + 2 is equal to `r 2 + 2`, or pi rounded to the first 5 digits is `r round(pi, 5)`.
